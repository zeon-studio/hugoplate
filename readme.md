### ⚙ Prerequisites

### 👉 Project Setup

We built this custom script to make your project setup easier. It will create a new Hugo theme folder and clone the Hugoplate theme into it. Then move the exampleSite folder into the root directory.

```bash
npm run project-setup
```

### 👉 Install Dependencies

Install all the dependencies using the following command.

```bash
npm install
```
